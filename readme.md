1. **Use Inline Code Blocks for Equations**: You can use inline or block code formatting to make the equations more readable, although this won't render them as nicely as LaTeX. This works for simple equations but may be limited for more complex formulas.

2. **Convert LaTeX Equations to Images**: You can convert the LaTeX equations into images and include them in your README. This way, they’ll render clearly, but the downside is they won’t be editable as text.

3. **Use GitHub Pages or Jupyter Notebooks**: If you need full LaTeX support, you could use GitHub Pages with Jekyll to host the documentation as a website or create a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that supports LaTeX equations and then link to it from your README.

Here’s an example of how to adapt the equations to GitHub Markdown for your README.

# Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) Model

## Introduction

The **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)** model is a multimodal architecture designed to process and integrate information from multiple data types, such as text, images, and speech. By using unique transformer layers for each modality and a shared global attention mechanism, MoT captures both unique modality-specific patterns and cross-modal interactions.

## Architecture Overview

### Transformer Encoder Layer

Each encoder layer includes:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Calculates weights for each input position based on relevance to others, enabling the model to focus on key parts of the input sequence.
- **Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Each position passes through a feed-forward network to add complexity and depth.

#### Self-Attention Calculation

For a given modality `m`, we compute the self-attention as follows:

1. **Linear Projections**: The input sequence \( X^{(m)} \) is projected to `query (Q)`, `key (K)`, and `value (V)` matrices:

   ```
   Q^(m) = X^(m) * W_Q^(m)
   K^(m) = X^(m) * W_K^(m)
   V^(m) = X^(m) * W_V^(m)
   ```

2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**:

   ```
   Attention(Q^(m), K^(m), V^(m)) = softmax((Q^(m) * K^(m).T) / sqrt(d_k)) * V^(m)
   ```

   where `d_k` is the dimensionality of each head.

3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Concatenate and project the output of each head:

   ```
   MultiHead(Q^(m), K^(m), V^(m)) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h) * W_O^(m)
   ```

#### Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)

Each position in the sequence goes through a feed-forward network:

   ```
   FFN(X^(m)) = GELU(X^(m) * W_1^(m) + b_1^(m)) * W_2^(m) + b_2^(m)
   ```

#### Modality and Positional Embeddings

To add modality and positional information:

1. **Modality Embeddings**: Each modality `m` has an embedding `E_mod^(m)`, which is added to the input:

   ```
   X^(m) = X^(m) + E_mod^(m)
   ```

2. **Positional Encoding**: Added to retain sequence information:

   ```
   X^(m) = X^(m) + E_pos
   ```

## Global Self-Attention Layer

After modality-specific processing, representations pass through a global self-attention layer to capture cross-modal dependencies.

1. **Global Multi-Head Attention**:

   ```
   X_hat^(m) = X_L^(m) + GlobalMultiHead(LayerNorm(X_L^(m)))
   ```
